# 📋Project 5-Restaurant Reviews App

![Alt text](img/overview.png?raw=true)

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The task is to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I have added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## ✅ Challenge

I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. My job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
